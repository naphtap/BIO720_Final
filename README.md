# BIO720_Final
Here is the repository containing all the perl scripts I prepared for the Graduate Bioinformatics Final Project. I have prepared 5 scripts for this project, each of which either runs a bioinformatics program or modifies an input file for compatibility with another program. Below, I provide the name of the script along with a brief description of its function.

_fastqc.pl_: Provides a zipped file and .html file containing information on the quality of the input reads.

_FLASh.pl_: Merges .fastq files that are pair-ended reads into single-ended reads.

_Trimmomatic:pl_: Trims low-quality sequencing reads from .fastq files based on base nucleotide quality.

_BLAST.pl_: Runs BLAST to annotate sequences environmental 16S sequences to a custom 16S database.

_IDtoGreengenes.pl_: Processes input file containing 16S read abundances and converts NCBI Taxon IDs to its associated Greengenes taxon string
